• Developed comprehensive C++ math library with 3D/4D vectors, matrices, transformations, and trigonometric functions supporting SIMD operations.

• Built DirectX 11 graphics engine featuring scene management, shader pipeline, texture rendering, and state management with wireframe/solid modes.

• Implemented hierarchical tree data structure (PCSTree) with parent-child-sibling relationships for efficient scene graph management.

• Created robust file I/O library with error handling, base directory management, and Windows API integration for asset loading.

• Designed modular DLL architecture with clean interfaces between Math, File, PCSTree, and Engine components for maintainable code.

• Engineered camera system with orbital, first-person, top-down, and behind-view modes using view/projection matrix transformations.
